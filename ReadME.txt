benchmarks directory contains benchmarks from DIMACS for Greedy and Genetics Algorithm. 
benchmarks1 directory contains the files on which Ga and Greedy algorithms as tested
test directory ontains testbenchmarks for A-Star algorithm.
Both the directories in the same folder as the .py files

Genetics Algorithm:
To run GA, execute Modified_pyevolve_ex12_tsp.py. It will prompt for the input folder, if you want to run for Diamacs, enter bennchmarks, else enter your own folder.
If the name of the input file is 'att48.tsp', then the tour will be written in 'att48_tsp_result_for_Ga.txt'.
The tour length, time  and filename is written in 'tsp_result_for_ga.txt'.

Greedy Algorithm:
To run Greedy, execute hw4_greedy.py. It will prompt for the input folder, if you want to run for Diamacs, enter benchmarks, else enter your own folder.
If the name of the input file is 'att48.tsp', then the tour will be written in 'att48_tsp_result_for_greedy.txt'.
The tour length, time  and filename is written in 'tsp_result_for_greedy.txt'.

A-Star Algorithm:
To run Greedy, execute hw4_astar.py. It will prompt for the input folder, if you want to run for Diamacs, enter benchmarks, else enter your own folder.Preferd to enter test, which will execute 3 validation tests for astar.
If the name of the input file is 'att48.tsp', then the tour will be written in 'att48_tsp_result_for_astar.txt'.
The tour length, time  and filename is written in 'tsp_result_for_astar.txt'.
